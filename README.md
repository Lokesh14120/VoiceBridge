# VoiceBridge
My project, Voice Bridge, is a web application that is designed for developers to communicate with each other through voice chat.
It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) which provides a powerful and efficient framework for web development.

The application's authentication is done using JWT authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access the voice chat feature.
To facilitate peer-to-peer connection, I used WebRTC, a powerful real-time communication protocol that allows for low-latency and secure communication.

To enhance the real-time functionality of the application, I used socket.io, a powerful library that allows for easy implementation of real-time communication between the client and server.
In addition, I used protected routes from React to handle the login process, which ensures that only logged-in users can access the voice chat feature.

Finally, I used the Redux toolkit for global state management which makes the application more efficient and user-friendly.
All in all Voice Bridge is a powerful and user-friendly web application that allows developers to communicate with each other through voice chat in a secure and efficient manner.
